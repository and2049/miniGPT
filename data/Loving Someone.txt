Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone

My heart is telling me the telly isn't telling me anything
I need but it needs to keep selling me
Besides celebrities lacking in integrity
Holding up the status quo instead of showing the kids
That they matter, who are they gonna batter next?
Just keep holding their necks and keep selling them sex
Itâ€™s better if we keep them perplexed
It's better if we make them want the opposite sex
And disenfranchised young criminal minds
In a car park beside where your nan resides
Are not slow, they've just never been shown
That you should be

Loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone

We're all human, we're just like you man
We're sentient, or something or other
I can't remember, whatever
We shouldn't have people afloat
If it was safer on the ground, we wouldn't be on a boat
Charlatan telepathy exploiting insecurity and praying on the purity
Of grief and its simplicity but I know that maybe I'm too skeptical
Even Guy Debord needed spectacles, you see
I'm the Greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques
And now I'm trying to progress, but instead of selling sex
And I think I should be

Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be

I am forever in alongside the boys in jumpers
On bikes from schools and cars
With autumn leaves fallen sparse across the mid-afternoon
She blazed about how cultural language is an operating system
A simple interface rendered feeble and listless
When tested with a divinity or a true understanding of the human condition
I never did understand the duality of art and reality
Living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect
To touch that cajoles at the artist with comfort and abandon
And between the spires and rolling roofs of the white city
That orange, English light cast only one, singular shadow
For you are not beside but within me

Loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Oh, oh
