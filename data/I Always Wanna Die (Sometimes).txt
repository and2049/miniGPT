I bet you thought your life would change
But you're sat on a train again
Your memories are sceneries
For things you said but never really meant
You build it too high to say goodbye
Because you're not the same as them
But your death, it won't happen to you
It happens to your family and your friends, I pretend

And I always wanna die sometimes
I always wanna die sometimes

You win, you lose, you sing the blues
There's no point in buying concrete shoes, I refuse

And I always wanna die sometimes
I always wanna die sometimes
I always wanna die

When I'm me through geography
A face collapsed through entropy
I can hardly speak
And when I try, it's nothing but a squeak
On the video, living room for small
If you can't survive just try

And I always wanna die sometimes
I always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
And I always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
I sometimes always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna
Sometimes
