Hey now call it a split 'cause you know that you will
Oh you bite your friend like chocolate
You say, we'll go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it, no we're never gonna quit it, no

Now we run run away from the boys in the blue
And my car smells like chocolate
Hey now think about what you do, think about what they say
Think about how to think
Pause it play it, pause it play it, pause it

Oh we go where nobody knows, with guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna' quit it, no we're never gonna' quit it no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna' quit it no we're never gonna' quit it no

Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
If you don't stop smoking it
That's what she said
She said we're dressed in black, head to toe
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it, no we're never gonna quit it, no

Hey now we're building up speed as we're approaching the hill
Oh my hair smells like chocolate
Hey now you say you're gonna quit it but you're never gonna quit it
Go get it, go get it, go get it, go
And play it cool

Oh and you said we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna' quit it, no we're never gonna' quit it no
Yeah we're dressed in black, from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
We're never gonna' quit it, no we're never gonna' quit it no

Well I think we better go, seriously better go
Said it's better than hanging on
Seriously better go, oh oh
Well I think we better go
Said it's better than hanging on
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go

We go where nobody knows, with guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna' quit it, no we're never gonna' quit it no
Yeah we're dressed in black, head to toe
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

Well I think we better go, seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go
Oh oh, well I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go
