She said hello, she was letting me know
We shared friends in Soho
She is a pain in the nose
And I'm a pain in women's clothes
And you're a walking overdose in a great coat

And so she wrote a plan for it on the back of a fag packet
She had to leave because she couldn't hack it
Not a lot of noise and too much racket
I think I've spent all my money and your friends, oh

But how I'd love to go to Paris again (again, again, again and again)
Oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again (again, again, again and again)

Mr. Serotonin Man, lend me a gram
You call yourself a friend?
I got two left feet and I'm starting to cheat
On my girlfriend again
I caught a pinky in her nose
As the crowd cheered for an overdose
And I don't suppose you know where this train goes
There was a party that she had to miss
Because her friend kept cutting her wrists
Hyperpoliticized sexual trysts
Oh, I think my boyfriend's a nihilist
I said, hey kids we're all just the same
What a shame

Ya know, how I'd love to go to Paris again (again, again, again and again)
And how I'd love to go to Paris again (again, again, again and again)

Oh stop being an asshole
And counting my eye rolls
And like pistols falls in the snow
Uh oh
Keeping paying the tab on my half
Man you putting me up on a shelf
Well I believed you're clean
But only I've seen your fist for myself

And then she pointed at a bag of her dreams
In a well posh magazine
I said I'm done, babe I'm out of the scene,
But I was picking up from Bethnal Green
She said I've been romanticizing heroin

And oh how I'd love to go to Paris, to Paris again (again, again, again and again)
And how I'd love to go to Paris again (again, again, again and again)
And how I'd love to go to Paris again (again, again, again and again)
And how I'd love to go to Paris again (again, again, again and again)
