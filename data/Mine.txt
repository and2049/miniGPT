There comes a time in a young man's life
He should settle down and find himself a wife
But I'm just fine 'cause I know that you're mine

I fight crime online sometimes
And write rhymes I hide behind
And I switch her wine
Both crying, I'm fine
If you are fine

Looking back on 2009
When people said that it was rainin' all the time
I see sunshine 'cause I know that you're mine

And you say that I'm wasting your time
And I smile and tell you things'll be fine
For some reason I just can't say, "I do"

There comes a time in a young man's life
He should settle down and find himself a wife
But I'm just fine 'cause I know you are mine
