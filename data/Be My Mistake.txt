Be my mistake
Then turn out the light
She bought me those jeans
The ones you like

I don't want a hug
I just wanna sleep
The smell of your hair
Reminds me of her feet

So don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait 'til I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes

Save all the jokes you're gonna make
While I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake

I shouldn't have called
'Cause we shouldn't speak
You do make me hard
But she makes me weak

And don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait 'til I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes

Save all the jokes you're gonna make
While I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake
